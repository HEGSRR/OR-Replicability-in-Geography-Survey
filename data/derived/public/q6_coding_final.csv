Transferred to qualitative research, this means for me rather that one would use the same questions, analyse the data with the same methods, etc. The fact that the results are not necessarily the same is not a weakness, but rather to be expected, since our knowledge is always embedded and co-constructed.

For social surveys, we target anecdotal accounts from old people. As long as these interviewees are alive and still capable to answer questions that we gave,  next interviewers would likely gather similar information.
