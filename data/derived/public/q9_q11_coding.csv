Even if the research design is empirical (e.g. simulation studies), the data are often easy to replicate (provided the methods description is sufficiently detailed). Replicability is therefore not as much of a problem as in empirical fields of geography, which are more strongly concerned with complex real-world systems. What certainly has an influence on the performance of replication studies, however, is that they do not seem very interesting/popular in the light of the described lower importance in my subfield.",NA
"15","R_PAJVNCBkiV0GJrP","The unique position of a researcher should not make a difference if the approach and results are stored correctly. In fact, in my opinion replication would mean that we would also be able to test researchers with a unique position.","If local circumstances are a key determinant of the processes at work it seems difficult to replicate the (complete) study in another environment. Of course, other environments could test certain elements that are similar and evidence from multiple locations (even though they are different) would accumulate to better knowledge of the determinants and mechanisms at play. In this case, arriving at a similar result is not the purpose of replicating of course, only using the same methods and approach."

"32","R_2dFN8ER1GFcoFl9","I am not sure that the problem you are posing is methodological in nature. Results don't get reproduced in human geography not because of access to information or knowledge about certain types of techniques. In fact, the opposite is the case. The more a study is seen as ""additive"" (reproducing the techniques undertaken by someone else) the less likely it is going to be seen as ""transformative"" (doing something that other people have yet to do, and thus is novel, innovative, ""pathbreaking"". The ideology of performance metrics (in many ways tied to specific notions of what counts as good or legitimate research) are very often at odds with ensuring that results are transparently and accurately reproduced with alternative data. In your specific case, though, qualitative research is much harder to reproduce if you are doing ethnographic or interview-led research. These are approches that are inherently flexible to the evolution of the research participants and thus change as circumstances demand. Surveys might be easier to reproduce, but they also produce to different types of information. Quant work is easier to reproduce if you have the same type of data available in a different context, but that is about as far as that goes as even this data can be uneven in quality and comparability.",NA

"42","R_2zeUZXvv8xhigAK","I commonly see poorly documented methodology where it is not possible to identify parameters used in the study, rendering it almost impossible to replicate without performing expensive sensitivity studies. 

My field relies on exceptionally expensive field work. Hence we can often be explorers of the system, presenting observations that are new with data sets that are very expensive to replicate in different locations and time. The study also relies on researchers collecting adequate data to get robust statistical results. I have seen papers published in Nature (for example) that were later shown to not be statically robust with later data collection or further analysis. Highlighting not only the importance of replication but also of how the prestige in publishing is affecting the opinion of colleagues as to current knowledge. The falsified prestigious results getting more light than the finding that they were not interpreted correctly for example. 

Ego and status of players in the field affect the scientific method and who gets access to resources to test the findings of the big players. 

And the metrics used to measure scientific success for academics trying to stay in the field and their jobs affect the types of studies that are done. if your job security is tied to novel and publicly flashy results (self promotion, proving the worth of your work through being at the cutting edge of discovery not on the side of good scientific methods), you are less likely to be part of the machinery that ensures we are making robust findings as a community.","I listed somewhat likely simply because such studies might have a small chance of getting funded.
