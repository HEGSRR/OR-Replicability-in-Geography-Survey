### Welcome
This is an interactive data visualization for
*A Survey of Researcher Perceptions of Replication in Geography*
by Peter Kedron, Joseph Holler, and Sarah Bardin.

The purpose of the survey was to systematically develop a baseline of information
about the state of replicability in geography
and to identify any important differences between subfields and methodological approaches.

This data was collected with an online Qualtrics survey from October 3 to December 12, 2022
from a random sample of researchers publishing in geographic academic journals as the corresponding author.
The survey is the second in a two-part series. The first, on *reproducibility*, also has a data visualization and OSF project.

The survey inquires researchers about their:

1) understanding and **awareness** of replicability;
2) **factors** that impact the reproducibility of a study; 
3) **opinions** and perceptions about replicability and its roles and barriers in their subfield of geography; and
4) **experience** applying replicability in scholarship.

Within each of these themes, responses can be viewed in aggregate (**Everyone**).

Alternatively, subsets of geographers can be selected
according to one of four *subfields* they are most closely associated with:

- **Human** geography;
- Spatial analysis and **methods**;
- **Nature/Society**; or
- **Physical** geography.

Or, one of three *methods* they most frequently use:
- **Quantitative**;
- **Qualitative**; or
- **Mixed Methods**.
